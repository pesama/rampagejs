<a name="what-is-rampage" class="anchor" href="#what-is-rampage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Rampage?</h2>

<p>Rampage is a JavaScript Web Application Engine. It provides you with utilities that will help you developing clean, fast and reliable web applications, by abstracting you from browser or device differences and handing to you a fully controlled environment. You can get a web application running with Rampage in few minutes of coding.</p>

<h3>
<a name="yet-another-framework" class="anchor" href="#yet-another-framework"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Yet Another Framework?</h3>

<p>Actually, Rampage works in conjunction with top-rank frameworks (i.e. JQuery, JQueryUI and Knockout) in order to give the maximum and best capabilities to your application. Furthermore, thanks to this the core coding is not only intuitive to users (due to the similarities with well-known libraries) but widely tested by thousands of developers. This makes Rampage stable, fully-functional, and your application results are neat.</p>

<h3>
<a name="so-what-does-it-offer" class="anchor" href="#so-what-does-it-offer"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So, what does it offer?</h3>

<p>Rampage provides an applicative life-cycle which controls the environment at any time. With this basis the applications are always controlled, no matter the action being performed. Other advantages of using Rampage are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Easy dependency Importing - You can include dependencies from both your application and Rampage's core, with just one line of code.</li>
<li>Organized Application Layering - The logical and graphical layers are completely separated, so your application's data models could be independently executed.</li>
<li>Clean Graphics Abstraction - Rampage includes a Graphics render process, so you could use Visual Components as JavaScript objects, which will always be linked to their visual representations on the screen.</li>
<li>Automated Time Management - If your application is time-sensitive, you can use events triggered with complex time conditions.</li>
<li>Complete Offline Execution - You can use the local and session storages to save large amounts of data, letting your application run completely offline.</li>
<li>
<p>Smart Navigation Control - Users can go back and forth on your application as you want, and previous actions are restored.</p>

<a name="and-how-do-i-use-it" class="anchor" href="#and-how-do-i-use-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>And how do I use it?</h3>

<p>You need to follow this easy steps to get Rampage running for using it on your application:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Download it - Download the working copy directly from the repository, or go to <a href="http://www.rampagejs.com/#downloads">http://www.rampagejs.com/#downloads</a> (Under construction).</p></li>
<li><p>Define your application and register it - You can follow the Quick Start Guide, or Get a Blank Project. (Under construction).</p></li>
<li><p>All setup! - Rampage will be ready, and you can use it to develop your application. Enjoy!</p></li>
</ul><p>You can take a read to the full documentation on <a href="http://doc.rampagejs.com/">http://doc.rampagejs.com/</a> (Under construction), or test out all Rampage's capabilities by going to <a href="http://playground.rampagejs.com/">http://playground.rampagejs.com/</a> (Under construction).</p>
